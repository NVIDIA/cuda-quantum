# Nothing/nobody should write to this branch except the CLA bot.
# To avoid giving the bot admin rights, the branch protection is configured to require PRs + approval from code owners, 
# and to allow the bot to bypass these requirements.
# Code owners should hence be nobody for the branch to be effectively locked for everyone except the bot.
