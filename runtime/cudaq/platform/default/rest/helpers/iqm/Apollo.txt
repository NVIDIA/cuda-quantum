# The format of the file is as follows:
# 1. You must specify the number of nodes
Number of nodes: 20

# 2. Specifying the number of edges is optional
Number of edges: 60

# 3. For each node, list the connections as:
# <NodeNumber> --> { <ConnectedNode1>, <ConnectedNode2>, ... }
# Notes:
# - Node numbers are 0-based
# - Each node's info must be entirely on one line.
# - The nodes and lines do not have to be in order.
# - Connections are assumed to be bidirectional.
# - Any duplicates will be automatically removed.
