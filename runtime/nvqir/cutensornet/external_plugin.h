/// (1) The extension
/// library should expose a C-API function with the signature:
///
///    CutensornetExecutor* getCutnExecutor();
///
///  The backend shall look for that symbol to retrieve the extension.
///
/// (2) The extension library should be linked against the same (or compatible)
/// cutensornet library version.
///
/// (3) Provide CMAKE flag:
/// `-DCUDAQ_CUTENSORNET_PLUGIN_LIB=<path to compiled extension lib>` when
/// building the tensornet backends.
