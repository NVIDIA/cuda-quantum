      placeholder: |
        Consider providing a _minimal_ code example: no external dependencies,
        isolating the function(s) that cause the issue. It should also be
        _complete_ C++ or Python snippets that can be easily compiled and
        executed to diagnose the issue.

        Give the steps to reproduce the bug. A [minimal working example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)
        of code with output is best. If you are copying in code, please remember to enclose it in triple backticks
        (` ``` [multiline code goes here] ``` `) so that it [displays correctly](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#quoting-code).

        For the CUDA Quantum version, please give the actual version number
        (_e.g._ 0.3.0) if you are using a release version, or the first 7-8
        characters of the commit hash if you have built from source. If you are
        using the python interface _and_ have not built it from source, you can
        remove the 'C++ compiler' entry. If you are not using python, you
        can remove 'Python version' entry. Feel free to add anything else that
        is relevant to the list.
