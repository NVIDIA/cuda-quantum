    "# Multi-reference Quantum Krylov Algorithm - $H_2$ Molecule\n",
    "\n",
    "The multireference selected quantum Krylov (MRSQK) algorithm is defined in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05163) and was developed as a low-cost alternative to quantum phase estimation. This tutorial will demonstrate how this algorithm can be implemented in CUDA-Q and accelerated using multiple GPUs. The [CUDA-Q Hadamard test tutorial](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/applications/python/hadamard_test.html) might provide helpful background information for understanding this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by preparing an initial state, and then defining this state in a smaller subspace constructed with a basis that corresponds to Trotter steps of the initial state. This subspace can be diagonalized to produce an approximate energy for the system without variational optimization of any parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, the initial guess is the ground state of the diagonalized Hamiltonian for demonstration purposes.  In practice one could use a number of heuristics to prepare the ground state such as Hartree Fock or CISD. A very promising ground state preparation method which can leverage quantum computers is the linear combination of unitaries (LCU). LCU would allow for the state preparation to occur completely on the quantum computer and avoid storing an inputting the exponentially large state vector.\n",
