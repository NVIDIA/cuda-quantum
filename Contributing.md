# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CUDA Quantum! Based on the type
of contribution, it will fall into three categories:

1. Report a bug, feature request, or documentation issue:

    File an [issue][cuda_quantum_issues] describing what you encountered or what
    you want to see changed. The NVIDIA team will evaluate the issues and triage
    them, scheduling them for a release. If you believe the issue needs priority
    attention comment on the issue to notify the team.

1. Share your work built upon CUDA Quantum:

    We would love to hear more about your work! Please share with us on
    [NVIDIA/cudaq GitHub
    Discussions](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/discussions) or consider
    contributing to our [examples](./docs/sphinx/examples/)! We also take any
    CUDA Quantum related questions on this forum.

1. Implement a feature or bug-fix:

    Please file an [issue][cuda_quantum_issues] on the repository and express
    your interest in contributing to its implementation. Someone from the CUDA
    Quantum team will respond on the issue to discuss how to best proceed with
    the suggestion. For more information regarding contributing to the code
    base, see also [Developing.md](./Developing.md).
