CUDA-Q Academic
=================

`CUDA-Q Academic <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-q-academic>`_  is a collection of courses designed for academic use based on the CUDA-Q platform.  Courses range in complexity from the basics of quantum computing up to implementations of algorithms from the research literature.  Users will learn quantum computing, CUDA-Q, and how to run hybrid algorithms that make the most of QPUs and AI supercomputers.  

The courses can be run using a local installation of CUDA-Q or via the cloud using qBraid, CoCalc, or Google Colab.

Users just learning quantum computing are encouraged to begin with the `Quick Start to Quantum <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-q-academic/tree/main/quick-start-to-quantum>`_ course which provides an introduction to the basics of quantum computing and helps you implement your first algorithm. 

Advanced users can choose from a number of learning paths spanning topics ranging from QEC to hybrid algorithms `here  <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-q-academic>`_ .
