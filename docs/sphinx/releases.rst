CUDA Quantum Releases
************************

**latest**

The latest version of CUDA Quantum is on the main branch of our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum>`__ and is also available as a Docker image. More information about installing the nightly builds can be found :doc:`here <install>`

- `Docker image (nightly builds) <https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nightly/containers/cuda-quantum>`__
- `Documentation <https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest>`__
- `Examples <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/tree/main/docs/sphinx/examples>`__

**0.5.0**

With 0.5.0 we have added support for quantum kernel execution on OQC and IQM backends. For more information, see :doc:`using/hardware`.
CUDA Quantum now allows to executing adaptive quantum kernels on quantum hardware backends that support it.
The 0.5.0 release furthermore improves the tensor network simulation tools and adds a matrix product state simulator, see :doc:`using/simulators`.

Additionally, we are now publishing images for experimental features, which currently includes improved Python language support.
Please take a look at :doc:`install` for more information about how to obtain them.

**0.4.0**

CUDA Quantum is now available on PyPI!
The 0.4.0 release adds support for quantum kernel execution on Quantinuum and IonQ backends. For more information, see :doc:`using/hardware`.

The 0.4.0 PyPI release does not yet include all of the GPU-based backends.
The fully featured version is available as a Docker image for `linux/amd64` platforms.
