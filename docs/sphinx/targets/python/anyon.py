# You only have to set the target once! No need to redefine it

# To use different targets in the same file, you must update
# it via another call to `cudaq.set_target()`

# To use the Anyon target you will need to set up credentials in ~/.anyon_config
# The configuration file should contain your Anyon Technologies username and password:
# credentials: {"username":"<username>","password":"<password>"}

# Set the target to the default QPU
cudaq.set_target("anyon")

# You can specify a specific machine via the machine parameter:
# cudaq.set_target("anyon", machine="telegraph-8q")
# or for the larger system:
# cudaq.set_target("anyon", machine="berkeley-25q")

# Get the results of the restored future.

# will be executed on Anyon and the calling thread will be blocked
# until the results are returned.
