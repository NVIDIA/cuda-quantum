Welcome to the CUDA Quantum documentation page!

CUDA Quantum streamlines hybrid application development and promotes productivity and scalability
in quantum algorithm research. It offers a unified programming model designed for a hybrid
setting |---| that is, CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs working together. Further enabling application
acceleration, CUDA Quantum includes language extensions for Python and C++ and a system-level toolchain.

You are browsing the documentation for |version| version of CUDA Quantum. You can find documentation for all released versions :doc:`here <versions>`.

**CUDA Quantum** is a programming model and toolchain for using quantum acceleration in heterogeneous computing architectures available in C++ and Python.
