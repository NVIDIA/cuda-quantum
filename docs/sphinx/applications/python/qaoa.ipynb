    "# Max-Cut with QAOA\n",
    "\n",
    "[Farhi et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028) introduced the quantum approximation optimization algorithm (QAOA) to solve optimization problems like the max cut problem. Before diving into the details of QAOA, we'll first define the max cut problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Max Cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_cut) is the problem of finding a partition of a graph's nodes into two sets which maximizes the edges between the two sets. Although this problem is relatively easy to solve for graphs with few vertices, this problem is [NP-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness#:~:text=7%20References-,Definition,complete%20problem%20G%20to%20H.). The max cut problem has a wide range of applications including [machine learning](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume14/wang13a/wang13a.pdf), [circuit design](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/materials/2020/Hong-Lee-Wei.pdf) and [statistical physics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262162554_An_Application_of_Combinatorial_Optimization_to_Statistical_Physics_and_Circuit_Layout_Design), among others. Furthermore, the QAOA algorithm presented in this tutorial can be adapted to other related optimization problems with an even wider application field including [portfolio optimization](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.043204) and [job shop scheduling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221723002072), just to name a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "We take the convention that $G=(V,E)$ represents a graph with vertex set $V\\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ and edge set $E\\subseteq V\\times V$. We use the terms vertex and node interchangeably.  For this tutorial we assume that the graphs are undirected (that is, $(u,v)$ and $(v,u)$ represent the same edge). Our graphs contain no self loops (i.e., for every vertex $v$, there is no edge $(v,v)$). A *cut* of the graph $G$ is a partition, $(V_0,V_1)$, of the vertex set such that every vertex of $V$ is a member of exactly one of $V_0$ or $V_1$ (i.e., $V_0\\bigcup V_1 = V$ and $V_0\\bigcap V_0=\\emptyset$). The *cut value* for a partition is the sum of the edges with one node in $V_0$ and one node in $V_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the images below, we illustrate two cuts of a graph with the dotted lines. Each of these cuts partitions the graph into two disjoint sets. The cut on the left is not optimal, and the cut on the right is the max cut. The cut on the left divides the graph into disjoint sets $\\{1,2\\}$ and $\\{0,3,4\\}$, and that cut contains 3 edges. To more easily visualize the cut, we have colored the vertices in one set of the partition green and the vertices in the other set of the partition gray.\n",
    "The cut depicted in the diagram on the right divides the graph vertices into two disjoint sets $V_0=\\{0,2\\}$, colored gray, and $V_1=\\{1,3,4\\}$, colored green. The number of edges connecting vertices in the distinct sets is computed by $$\\sum_{\\substack{u \\in V_0; v\\in V_1\\\\ (u,v) \\in E}}1.$$ For the graph on the right, the number of edges in the cut (in this case there are $5$ edges) is maximal, and this value is referred to as the *max cut value*. The partitioning $(V_0,V_1)$  &mdash; and sometimes the set of edges connecting vertices in $V_0$ and $V_1$  &mdash; is referred to as a *max cut of a graph*. Note that the max cut of a graph need not be unique; that is, two distinct partitions may produce the same cut value.\n",

    "![](images/max-cut-illustration.png)\n",
    " \n",
    "We will use bitstrings to identify vertices in each of the two partitions. For example using the ordering of the vertices, the bitstring `01100` captures the partition in the image above on the left with vertices $1$ and $2$ in $V_1$, and the bitstring `01011` codes the partition in the image on the right with vertices $1$, $3$, and $4$ in $V_1$.\n",

    "As mentioned earlier, QAOA is a variational algorithm that aims to minimize a cost function. To apply QAOA to the max cut problem, we assign a binary variable $z_v$ to each vertex $v$. These variables will take on the vales $-1$ or $1$. Notice that an assignment of variable values corresponds to a partition of the graph.  For example, $\\bar z = [-1, 1, -1, 1, 1]$ would partition the graph into two sets: $\\{0,2\\}$ and $\\{1,3,4\\}.$ We can compute the cut value of the graph for an arbirtrary assignment of variable values by the formula: $$C(\\bar{z})= \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{(u,v)\\in E} (1-z_uz_v),$$ where $E$ is the set of edges of our graph.  Our goal is to find a variable assignment that maximizes $C(\\bar z)$.  Equivalently, we want to find a variable assignment that minimizes $-C(\\bar z)$. Since QAOA identifies minimum values, we have reframed the max cut optimization problem from one of maximization to minimization. Furthermore, we can promote this equation to a matrix equation by replacing $z_uz_v-1$ with Pauli-Z operators acting on qubits associated with nodes $u$ and $v$, respectively, and replacing 1 with the identity matrix. This leads to the reformulation of the problem from one of maximizing $C(\\bar{z})$ to one of minimizing the eigenvalues of $$H= \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{(u,v)\\in E} (Z_uZ_v-II).$$  \n",
