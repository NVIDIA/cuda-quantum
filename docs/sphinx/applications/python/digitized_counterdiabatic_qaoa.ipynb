    "# Molecular docking via DC-QAOA\n",
    "\n",
    "Drugs often work by binding to an active site of a protein, inhibiting or activating its function for some therapeutic purpose. Finding new candidate drugs is extremely difficult. The study of molecular docking helps guide this search and involves the prediction of how strongly a certain ligand (drug) will bind to its target (usually a protein).  \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary challenges to molecular docking arises from the many geometric degrees of freedom present in proteins and ligands, making it difficult to predict the optimal orientation and assess if the drug is a good candidate or not. One solution is to formulate the problem as a mathematical optimization problem where the optimal solution corresponds to the most likely ligand-protein configuration. This optimization problem can be solved on a quantum computer using methods like the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). This tutorial demonstrates how this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04098) used digitized-counteradiabatic (DC) QAOA to study molecular docking.  This tutorial assumes you have an understanding of QAOA, if not, please see the CUDA-Q MaxCut tutorial found [here](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/applications/python/qaoa.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 6 key steps:\n",
    "1.  The experimental protein and ligand structures are determined and used to select pharmacores, or an important chemical group that will govern the chemical interactions.\n",
    "2. Two labeled distance graphs (LAGs) of size $N$ and $M$ represent the protein and the ligand, respectively. Each node corresponds to a pharmacore and each edge weight corresponds to the distance between pharmacores.\n",
    "3.  A $M*N$ node binding interaction graph (BIG) is created from the LAGs. Each node in the BIG graph corresponds to a pair of pharmacores, one from the ligand and the other from the protein. The existence of edges between nodes in the BIG graph are determined from the LAGs and correspond to interactions that can feesibly coexist. Therefore, cliques in the graph correspond to mutually possible interactions. \n",
    "4. The problem is mapped to a QAOA circuit and corresponding Hamiltonian. From there, the ground state solution is determined.\n",
    "5.  The ground state will produce the maximum weighted clique which corresponds to the best (most strongly bound) orientation of the ligand and protein.\n",
    "6.  The predicted docking structure is interpreted from the QAOA result and is used for further analysis.\n"
