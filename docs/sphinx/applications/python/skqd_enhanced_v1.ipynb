                "**Sample-Based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD)** is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that combines the theoretical guarantees of Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (KQD) with the practical efficiency of sample-based methods. Instead of expensive quantum measurements to compute Hamiltonian matrix elements, SKQD samples from quantum states to construct a computational subspace, then diagonalizes the Hamiltonian within that subspace classically.\n",
