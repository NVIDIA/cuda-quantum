Kernel measurement can be specified in the Z, X, or Y basis using `mz`, `mx`, and `my`. Measurement occurs in the Z basis by default.

Specific qubits or registers can be measured rather than the entire kernel.

Mid-circuit Measurement and Conditional Logic
----------------------------------------------

In certain cases, it is helpful for some operations in a quantum kernel to depend on measurement results following previous operations. This is accomplished in the following example by performing a Hadamard on qubit 0, then measuring qubit 0 and saving the result as `b0`. Then, qubit 0 can be reset and used later in the computation. In this case it is flipped to a 1. Finally, an if statement performs a Hadamard on qubit 1 if `b0` is 1.

The results show qubit 0 is one, indicating the reset worked, and qubit 1 has a 75/25 distribution, demonstrating the mid-circuit measurement worked as expected.
