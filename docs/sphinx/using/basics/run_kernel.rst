Running your first CUDA-Q Program
----------------------------------------

Now that you have defined your first quantum kernel, let's look at different options for how to execute it.
In CUDA-Q, quantum circuits are stored as quantum kernels. For estimating the probability distribution of 
a measured quantum state in a circuit, we use the ``sample`` function call, and for computing the
expectation value of a quantum state with a given observable, we use the ``observe`` function call.

Sample
++++++++

.. tab:: Python

  The :func:`cudaq.sample` method takes a kernel and its arguments as inputs, and returns a :class:`cudaq.SampleResult`.
  This result dictionary contains the distribution of measured states for the system.
  Continuing with the GHZ kernel defined in :doc:`Building Your First CUDA-Q Program <build_kernel>`,
  we will set the concrete value of our `qubit_count` to be two. The following will assume this code exists in
  a file named `sample.py`.

  .. literalinclude:: ../../snippets/python/using/first_sample.py
        :language: python
        :start-after: [Begin Sample1]
        :end-before: [End Sample1]

  By default, `sample` produces an ensemble of 1000 shots. This can be changed by specifying an integer argument
  for the `shots_count`.

  .. literalinclude:: ../../snippets/python/using/first_sample.py
        :language: python
        :start-after: [Begin Sample2]
        :end-before: [End Sample2]

  A variety of methods can be used to extract useful information from a :class:`cudaq.SampleResult`. For example,
  to return the most probable measurement and its respective probability:

  .. literalinclude:: ../../snippets/python/using/first_sample.py
        :language: python
        :start-after: [Begin Sample3]
        :end-before: [End Sample3]

  We can execute this program as we do any Python file.

  .. code-block:: console

      python3 sample.py

  See the :doc:`API specification <../../../api/languages/python_api>` for further information.

.. tab:: C++

        :start-after: [Begin Sample3]
        :end-before: [End Sample3]

  We can now compile this file with the `nvq++` toolchain, and run it as we do any other
  C++ executable.

  .. code-block:: console

      nvq++ sample.cpp
      ./a.out

  See the :doc:`API specification <../../../api/languages/cpp_api>` for further information.

Sample Asynchronous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to
start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive
to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until
that task has finished. Once that task has finished, your program is
presented with the result.

``sample`` can be a time intensive task. We can parallelize the
execution of ``sample`` via the arguments it accepts.

.. code:: python

    # Parallelize over the various kernels one would like to execute.
    
    import cudaq
    
    qubit_count = 2
    
    # Set the simulation target.
    cudaq.set_target("nvidia-mqpu")
    
    # Kernel 1
    
    
    @cudaq.kernel
    def kernel_1(qubit_count: int):
        qvector = cudaq.qvector(qubit_count)
    
        # 2-qubit GHZ state.
        h(qvector[0])
        for i in range(1, qubit_count):
            x.ctrl(qvector[0], qvector[i])
    
        # If we dont specify measurements, all qubits are measured in
        # the Z-basis by default.
        mz(qvector)
    
    
    # Kernel 2
    
    
    @cudaq.kernel
    def kernel_2(qubit_count: int):
        qvector = cudaq.qvector(qubit_count)
    
        # 2-qubit GHZ state.
        h(qvector[0])
        for i in range(1, qubit_count):
            x.ctrl(qvector[0], qvector[i])
    
        # If we dont specify measurements, all qubits are measured in
        # the Z-basis by default.
        mz(qvector)
    
    
    if cudaq.num_available_gpus() > 1:
        # Asynchronous execution on multiple virtual QPUs, each simulated by an NVIDIA GPU.
        result_1 = cudaq.sample_async(kernel_1, qubit_count, shots_count=1000, qpu_id=0)
        result_2 = cudaq.sample_async(kernel_2, qubit_count, shots_count=1000, qpu_id=1)
    else:
        # Schedule for execution on the same virtual QPU.
        result_1 = cudaq.sample_async(kernel_1, qubit_count, shots_count=1000, qpu_id=0)
        result_2 = cudaq.sample_async(kernel_2, qubit_count, shots_count=1000, qpu_id=0)
    
    print(result_1.get())
    print(result_2.get())


.. parsed-literal::

    { 00:493 11:507 }
    
    { 00:509 11:491 }
    


Similar to the above, one can also parallelize over the ``shots_count``
or the variational parameters of a quantum circuit.

Observe
+++++++++

.. tab:: Python

  The :func:`cudaq.observe` method takes a kernel and its arguments as inputs, along with a :class:`cudaq.SpinOperator`.
  As opposed to :func:`cudaq.sample`, `observe` is primarily used to produce expectation values of a kernel with respect
  to a provider operator.

  Using the `cudaq.spin` module, operators may be defined as a linear combination of Pauli strings. Functions, such
  as :func:`cudaq.spin.i`, :func:`cudaq.spin.x`, :func:`cudaq.spin.y`, :func:`cudaq.spin.z` may be used to construct more
  complex spin Hamiltonians on multiple qubits.
  
  Below is an example of a spin operator object consisting of a `Z(0)` operator, or a Pauli Z-operator on the zeroth qubit. 
  This is followed by the construction of a kernel with a single qubit in an equal superposition. 
  The Hamiltonian is printed to confirm it has been constructed properly.

  .. literalinclude:: ../../snippets/python/using/first_observe.py
        :language: python
        :start-after: [Begin Observe1]
        :end-before: [End Observe1]

  :code:`cudaq::observe` takes a kernel, any kernel arguments, and a spin operator as inputs and produces an `ObserveResult` object.
  The expectation value can be printed using the `expectation` method. 
  
  .. note:: 
    It is important to exclude a measurement in the kernel, otherwise the expectation value will be determined from a collapsed 
    classical state. For this example, the expected result of 0.0 is produced.

  .. literalinclude:: ../../snippets/python/using/first_observe.py
        :language: python
        :start-after: [Begin Observe2]
        :end-before: [End Observe2]

  Unlike `sample`, the default `shots_count` for :code:`cudaq::observe` is 1. This result is deterministic and equivalent to the
  expectation value in the limit of infinite shots.  To produce an approximate expectation value from sampling, `shots_count` can
  be specified to any integer.

  .. literalinclude:: ../../snippets/python/using/first_observe.py
        :language: python
        :start-after: [Begin Observe3]
        :end-before: [End Observe3]

Observe Asynchronous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to ``sample_async`` above, ``observe`` also supports
asynchronous execution for the `arguments it
accepts <https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/api/languages/python_api.html#cudaq.sample_async:~:text=cudaq.observe_async(),%C2%B6>`__.
One can parallelize over various kernels, spin operators, variational
parameters or even noise models.

Running on a GPU
++++++++++++++++++

.. tab:: Python

  Using :func:`cudaq.set_target`, different targets can be specified for kernel execution.
  
  If a local GPU is detected, the target will default to `nvidia`. Otherwise, the CPU-based simulation
  target, `qpp-cpu`,  will be selected.
  
  We will demonstrate the benefits of using a GPU by sampling our GHZ kernel with 25 qubits and a
  `shots_count` of 1 million. Using a GPU accelerates this task by more than 35x. To learn about
  all of the available targets and ways to accelerate kernel execution, visit the
  :doc:`Backends <../backends/backends>` page.

  .. literalinclude:: ../../snippets/python/using/time.py
        :language: python
        :start-after: [Begin Time]
        :end-before: [End Time]


.. tab:: C++

  Using the `--target` argument to `nvq++`, different targets can be specified for kernel execution.
  
  If a local GPU is detected, the target will default to `nvidia`. Otherwise, the CPU-based simulation
  target, `qpp-cpu`,  will be selected.
  
  We will demonstrate the benefits of using a GPU by sampling our GHZ kernel with 25 qubits and a
  `shots_count` of 1 million. Using a GPU accelerates this task by more than 35x. To learn about
  all of the available targets and ways to accelerate kernel execution, visit the 
  :doc:`Backends <../backends/backends>` page.

  To compare the performance, we can create a simple timing script that isolates just the call
  to :func:`cudaq.sample`. We are still using the same GHZ kernel as earlier, but the following
  modification made to the main function:

  .. literalinclude:: ../../snippets/cpp/using/time.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :start-after: [Begin Time]
    :end-before: [End Time]

  First we execute on the CPU backend:

  .. code:: console

    nvq++ --target=qpp-cpu sample.cpp
    ./a.out
  
  seeing an output of the order:
  ``It took 22.8337 seconds.``

  Now we can execute on the GPU enabled backend:

  .. code:: console

    nvq++ --target=nvidia sample.cpp
    ./a.out

  seeing an output of the order:
  ``It took 3.18988 seconds.``
