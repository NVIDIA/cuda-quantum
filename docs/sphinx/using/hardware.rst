CUDA Quantum Hardware Backends
*********************************

CUDA Quantum supports submission to a set of hardware providers. 
To submit to a hardware backend, you need an account with the respective provider.


Quantinuum
==================================

Setting Credentials
```````````````````

Programmers of CUDA Quantum may access the Quantinuum API from either
C++ or Python. Quantinuum requires a credential configuration file. 
The configuration file can be generated as follows, replacing
the ``email`` and ``credentials`` in the first line with your Quantinuum
account details.

.. code:: bash

    # You may need to run: `apt-get update && apt-get install curl jq`
    curl -X POST -H "Content Type: application/json" \
        -d '{ "email":"<your_alias>@email.com","password":"<your_password>" }' \
        https://qapi.quantinuum.com/v1/login > $HOME/credentials.json
    id_token=`cat $HOME/credentials.json | jq -r '."id-token"'`
    refresh_token=`cat $HOME/credentials.json | jq -r '."refresh-token"'`
    echo "key: $id_token" >> $HOME/.quantinuum_config
    echo "refresh: $refresh_token" >> $HOME/.quantinuum_config

The path to the configuration can be specified as an environment variable:

.. code:: bash

    export CUDAQ_QUANTINUUM_CREDENTIALS=$HOME/.quantinuum_config


Submission from C++
`````````````````````````

To target quantum kernel code for execution in the Quantinuum backends,
pass the flag ``--target ionq`` to the ``nvq++`` compiler. CUDA Quantum will 
authenticate via the Quantinuum REST API using the credential in your configuration file.
By default, quantum kernel code will be submitted to the Quantinuum syntax checker.
Submission to the syntax checker merely validates the program; the kernels are not executed.

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --target quantinuum src.cpp ...

To execute your kernels, pass the ``--quantinuum-machine`` flag to the ``nvq++`` compiler
to specify which machine to submit quantum kernels to:

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --target quantinuum --quantinuum-machine H1-2 src.cpp ...

where ``H1-2`` is an example of a physical QPU. Hardware specific
emulators may be accessed by appending an ``E`` to the end (e.g, ``H1-2E``). For 
access to the syntax checker for the provided machine, you may append an ``SC`` 
to the end (e.g, ``H1-1SC``).

For a comprehensive list of available machines, login to your `Quantinuum user account <https://um.qapi.quantinuum.com/user>`__ 
and navigate to the "Account" tab, where you should find a table titled "Machines".

To emulate the Quantinuum machine locally, without submitting through the cloud,
you can also pass the ``--emulate`` flag to ``nvq++``. This will emit any target 
specific compiler warnings and diagnostics, before running a noise free emulation.

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --emulate --target quantinuum src.cpp

To see a complete example for using Quantinuum's backends, take a look at our :ref:`C++ examples<cpp-examples-for-hardware-providers>`.


Submission from Python
`````````````````````````

The target to which quantum kernels are submitted 
can be controlled with the ``cudaq::set_target()`` function.

.. code:: python

    cudaq.set_target('quantinuum')

By default, quantum kernel code will be submitted to the Quantinuum syntax checker.
Submission to the syntax checker merely validates the program; the kernels are not executed.

To execute your kernels, specify which machine to submit quantum kernels to
by setting the :code:`machine` parameter of the target.

.. code:: python

    cudaq.set_target('quantinuum', machine='H1-2')

where ``H1-2`` is an example of a physical QPU. Hardware specific
emulators may be accessed by appending an ``E`` to the end (e.g, ``H1-2E``). For 
access to the syntax checker for the provided machine, you may append an ``SC`` 
to the end (e.g, ``H1-1SC``).

For a comprehensive list of available machines, login to your `Quantinuum user account <https://um.qapi.quantinuum.com/user>`__ 
and navigate to the "Account" tab, where you should find a table titled "Machines".

To emulate the Quantinuum machine locally, without submitting through the cloud,
you can also set the ``emulate`` flag to ``True``. This will emit any target 
specific compiler warnings and diagnostics, before running a noise free emulation.

.. code:: python

    cudaq.set_target('quantinuum', emulate=True)

The number of shots for a kernel execution can be set through
the ``shots_count`` argument to ``cudaq.sample`` or ``cudaq.observe``. By default,
the ``shots_count`` is set to 1000.

.. code:: python 

    cudaq.sample(kernel, shots_count=10000)

IonQ
==================================

Setting Credentials
`````````````````````````

Programmers of CUDA Quantum may access the `IonQ Quantum Cloud
<https://cloud.ionq.com/>`__ from either C++ or Python. Generate
an API key from your `IonQ account <https://cloud.ionq.com/>`__ and export
it as an environment variable:

.. code:: bash

  export IONQ_API_KEY="ionq_generated_api_key"

Submission from C++
`````````````````````````

To target quantum kernel code for execution in the IonQ Cloud,
pass the flag ``--target ionq`` to the ``nvq++`` compiler.

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --target ionq src.cpp

This will take the API key and handle all authentication with, and submission to,
the IonQ QPU(s). By default, quantum kernel code will be submitted to the IonQ
simulator.

.. note:: 

    A "target" in :code:`cudaq` refers to a quantum compute provider, such as :code:`ionq`.
    However, IonQ's documentation uses the term "target" to refer to specific QPU's themselves.

To execute your kernels on a QPU, pass the ``--ionq-machine`` flag to the ``nvq++`` compiler
to specify which machine to submit quantum kernels to:

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --target ionq --ionq-machine qpu.aria-1 src.cpp ...

where ``qpu.aria-1`` is an example of a physical QPU.

A list of available QPUs can be found `in the API documentation
<https://docs.ionq.com/#tag/jobs>`__. To see which backends are available 
with your subscription login to your `IonQ account <https://cloud.ionq.com/jobs>`__.

To emulate the IonQ machine locally, without submitting through the cloud,
you can also pass the ``--emulate`` flag to ``nvq++``. This will emit any target 
specific compiler diagnostics, before running a noise free emulation.

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --emulate --target ionq src.cpp

To see a complete example for using IonQ's backends, take a look at our :ref:`C++ examples<cpp-examples-for-hardware-providers>`.

Submission from Python
`````````````````````````

The target to which quantum kernels are submitted 
can be controlled with the ``cudaq::set_target()`` function.

.. code:: python

    cudaq.set_target('ionq')

By default, quantum kernel code will be submitted to the IonQ
simulator.

.. note:: 

    A "target" in :code:`cudaq` refers to a quantum compute provider, such as :code:`ionq`.
    However, IonQ's documentation uses the term "target" to refer to specific QPU's themselves.

To specify which IonQ QPU to use, set the :code:`qpu` parameter.

.. code:: python

    cudaq.set_target("ionq", qpu="qpu.aria-1")

where ``qpu.aria-1`` is an example of a physical QPU.

A list of available QPUs can be found `in the API documentation
<https://docs.ionq.com/#tag/jobs>`__. To see which backends are available 
with your subscription login to your `IonQ account <https://cloud.ionq.com/jobs>`__.

To emulate the IonQ machine locally, without submitting through the cloud,
you can also set the ``emulate`` flag to ``True``. This will emit any target 
specific compiler diagnostics, before running a noise free emulation.

.. code:: python

    cudaq.set_target('ionq', emulate=True)

The number of shots for a kernel execution can be set through
the ``shots_count`` argument to ``cudaq.sample`` or ``cudaq.observe``. By default,
the ``shots_count`` is set to 1000.

.. code:: python 

    cudaq.sample(kernel, shots_count=10000)
