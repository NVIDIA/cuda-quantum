Noise Modeling with CUDA Quantum
********************************

CUDA Quantum models incoherent noise via quantum channels, linear 
completely-positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) maps. Specifically 
CUDA Quantum requires the definition of a quantum channel via Kraus operators
that satisfy the CPTP condition (:math:`\sum_i K_i^\dagger K_i = \mathbf{I}`). 

Noise channels are composed of a list of Kraus operators and can be 
assigned for application after the application of a quantum operation. These 
channels can be stacked - multiple noise processes can be appended 
for a given quantum operation. These channels are specified to be applied to 
one or many qubits for a given operation. A Kraus channel should be able to 
be applied to a single qubit operation, or a multi-qubit, controlled operation. 

These channels transform the underlying density matrix representation of the quantum 
state in the following way 

.. math::

    \rho_{new} = \sum_i K_i \rho K_i^\dagger. 

Design 
------

To model this in CUDA Quantum, we put forward :code:`cudaq::kraus_op`, :code:`cudaq::kraus_channel`, 
and :code:`cudaq::noise_model`. 

A :code:`cudaq::kraus_op` encapsulates a :code:`vector` of :code:`complex` 
data modeling a 1-D flatten representation of a matrix with row-major ordering. It 
can be constructed from a :code:`vector` of data or an :code:`initializer_list` of data.

A :code:`cudaq::kraus_channel` encapsulates a :code:`vector` of :code:`kraus_op` instances that 
make up the quantum channel. The size of a :code:`kraus_channel` 
is the number of :code:`kraus_ops` it contains. :code:`kraus_channel` instances can be constructed 
from a variadic list of :code:`initializer_list` that enables :code:`kraus_op` construction in place. 
It can also be constructed directly from a vector of :code:`kraus_ops`. The 
constructor should validate the completeness (CPTP) relation. 

A :code:`cudaq::noise_model` encapsulates a mapping of quantum operation names to a 
vector of :code:`kraus_channel` that is to be applied after invocation of that 
quantum operation. A :code:`noise_model` can be constructed with a nullary constructor, and 
:code:`kraus_channels` can be added via a templated :code:`add_channel` method, where the 
template type is the quantum operation the channel applies to (e.g. :code:`model.add_channel\<cudaq::types::h\>(channel)`). Clients (e.g. simulator backends) can retrieve the :code:`kraus_channel` to 
apply to the simulated state via a :code:`noise_model::get_channel(...)` call. 

Noise models can be constructed via the :code:`cudaq::noise_model` and specified for 
execution via a public :code:`cudaq::set_noise(cudaq::noise_model&)` function. This function 
should forward the :code:`noise_model` to the current :code:`quantum_platform` which can attach it 
to the current :code:`ExecutionContext` and retrieved by backend simulators. 

The :code:`kraus_op` matrix data assumes a LSB qubit ordering.
