**NVIDIA CUDA Quantum**

CUDA Quantum streamlines hybrid application development and promotes productivity and scalability
in quantum algorithm research. It offers a unified programming model designed for a hybrid
setting |---| that is, CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs working together. Further enabling application
acceleration, CUDA Quantum includes language extensions for Python and C++ and a system-level toolchain.
