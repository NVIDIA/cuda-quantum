Control Flow
************
**[1]** All classical control flow expressions are inherited from the host language
(e.g. C++, Python). 

**[2]** Programmers can define quantum kernels using standard loop
constructs and conditional statements. 

**[3]** Conditional statements on quantum memory and measured :code:`cudaq::qudit` 
results are permitted.
