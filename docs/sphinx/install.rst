CUDA Quantum Open Beta Installation
*******************************************

Docker Image
--------------------

Install the Public Beta Docker Image
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This public beta release of CUDA Quantum is being deployed via 
a provided Docker image. The name of the image is :code:`nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda-quantum:0.3.0`,
and it has been built for :code:`x86_64,amd64` platforms. 

.. code-block:: console

    docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda-quantum:0.3.0

.. _use-cuda-quantum-in-terminal:

Use CUDA Quantum in a Terminal
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The container can be run using the following command

.. code-block:: console

    docker run -it --name cuda-quantum nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda-quantum:0.3.0

This will give you terminal access to the created container, but you are free to attach 
an existing VSCode IDE to it.

(what you'll see) 

.. code-block:: console 

    user@host:~$ docker run -it --name cuda-quantum nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda-quantum:0.3.0
    To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
    See "man sudo_root" for details.

    cpp  python

.. note:: 

    If you have NVIDIA GPUs available and NVIDIA Docker correctly configured, 
    you can add :code:`--gpus all` to the :code:`docker run` command to expose all available GPUs 
    to the container, or :code:`--gpus '"device=1"'` to select a specific GPU device.
    Unless you specify this flag, you will not be able to compile to the :code:`--qpu cuquantum`
    target. 

.. note:: 

    If you would like a temporary container, pass :code:`--rm`. This will delete your 
    container upon exit. 

You can stop and exit the container by typing the command :code:`exit`. If you did not specify
:code:`--rm`, the container still exists as well as any changes you made in it. You can get back to it using
the command :code:`docker start -i cuda-quantum`. 
You can delete an existing container and any changes you made using :code:`docker rm -v cuda-quantum`. 

Use CUDA Quantum in VS Code
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you have `VS Code`_ installed, you can use it to work inside your container.
To do so, install the `Dev Containers extension`_:

.. image:: _static/devContainersExtension.png 

Follow the steps :ref:`above<use-cuda-quantum-in-terminal>` to start the container. 
Open VS Code and navigate to the Remote Explorer. You should see the running cuda-quantum dev container listed there.

.. image:: _static/attachToDevContainer.png 

Click on :code:`Attach to Container`. A new VS Code instance will open in that container. Open the `/home/cudaq`
folder to see the README and the CUDA Quantum examples that are included in the container. To run the examples, 
open a terminal by going to the Terminal menu and select :code:`New Terminal`. 

.. image:: _static/openTerminal.png 

You can now compile and run the C++ examples using the :code:`nvq++` compiler, which is installed in your :code:`PATH`, 
or run the Python examples using the Python interpreter.

.. _Dev Containers extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers
.. _command palette: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette

.. note:: 

    VS Code extensions that you have installed locally, such as e.g. an extension for Jupyter notebooks, 
    may not be automatically active in the container environment. You may need to install your preferred 
    extension in the container environment for all of your dev tools to be available.


Build CUDA Quantum from Source
------------------------------

Here we will assume a Ubuntu 22.04 system. Adjust the package manager calls
for your distribution. Make sure that recent versions `cmake` and `ninja` installed.
The build also requires a recent version of `clang/clang++` or `gcc/g++`
(must have C++20 support).

Get the basic compilers you'll need via apt-get
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. code:: bash
  
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends gcc g++ 

On Ubuntu 22.04 this will get you GCC 11. 

Get cuQuantum (optional)
++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code:: bash 
    
    wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2004/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.0-1_all.deb \
    dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.0-1_all.deb
    apt-get update && apt-get -y install cuquantum cuquantum-dev 

Get LLVM / Clang / MLIR
++++++++++++++++++++++++

You will need the same version of LLVM as our submodule in `tpls/llvm`.

.. code:: bash 

    mkdir llvm-project && cd llvm-project
    git init 
    git remote add origin https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project 
    # note this will change as the project evolves, 
    # Must be == to the hash we use for the tpls/llvm submodule.
    git fetch origin --depth=1 c0b45fef155fbe3f17f9a6f99074682c69545488
    git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -G Ninja  
                -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="host" \
                -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/llvm/
                -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;mlir" 
                -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release 
                -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON 
                -DLLVM_INSTALL_UTILS=TRUE 
    ninja install
    # This is needed for FileCheck tests.
    cp bin/llvm-lit /opt/llvm/bin/

Build CUDA Quantum
++++++++++++++++++
You must use the same compiler that you compiled LLVM with to compile CUDA Quantum.

.. code:: bash
    
    git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum && cd cuda-quantum
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -G -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.cudaq 
                -DLLVM_DIR=/path/to/llvm/lib/cmake/llvm 
                -DCUDAQ_ENABLE_PYTHON=TRUE
                \# (optional, if cuquantum is installed)
                -DCUSTATEVEC=/opt/nvidia/cuquantum
    ninja install
    ctest 

Next Steps
----------
With the CUDA Quantum Docker image installed and a container up and running, check out the
Using CUDA Quantum page_. To run the examples codes in the container, checkout the Compiling
and Executing section here_. 

Once in the VSCode IDE or in the terminal for the container in headless mode, you'll 
notice there is an :code:`examples/` folder. These examples are provided to 
get you started with CUDA Quantum and understanding the programming and execution model. 
Start of by trying to compile a simple one, like :code:`examples/cpp/basics/static_kernel.cpp`

.. code-block:: console 

    nvq++ examples/cpp/basics/static_kernel.cpp 
    ./a.out

If you have GPU support (e.g. you successfully provided :code:`--gpus` to your docker 
run command), try out the 30 qubit version of this example.

.. code-block:: console 

    nvq++ examples/cpp/basics/cuquantum_backends.cpp --qpu cuquantum 
    ./a.out
