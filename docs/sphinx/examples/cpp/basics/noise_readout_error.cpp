  // Readout error model using the simplest constructor. This noise model is
  // that each qubit is treated independently, and with the same probabilities.

  // measured as |1> and p1 = p(0|1) = the probability that |1> is measure as
  // |0>.

  // Two other constructors worth including could be:
  // 1) Independent (but different) qubit readout errors. So a p0,p1 pair for
  // each qubit. and 2) Loading in the full 2^N by 2^N confusion matrix.

  // We will apply the readout error to the noise model
  noise.add_readout_error(error_model);

  // 10% of the time, and qubit 1 in the |0> state about 80% of the time.
