    "### Diffusion model pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative diffusion models (DMs) have recently delivered remarkable results across a wide range of applications, from image generation to protein folding. In this work, we leverage DMs to generate quantum circuits based on a user specified unitary matrix and a text prompt that defines the allowed gate set, effectively using DMs as unitary compilers. The method is thoroughly explained in Ref. [(Fürrutter et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-024-00831-9). The following figure  provides an overview of the proposed circuit generation pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/pipeline_simplified.png\" alt=\"Quantum circuit generation pipeline overview\" width=\"70%\"/>\n",
    "  <figcaption><b>Quantum circuit generation pipeline</b>. Figure adapted from <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-024-00831-9\">(Fürrutter et al., 2024)</a></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline consists on 3 main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Circuit encoding:** Like any neural network, diffusion models operate with continuous inputs and outputs. However, since the circuits we consider are composed of discrete gates (i.e., with no continuous parameters), we develop a mapping that transforms each gate into a continuous vector. This allows us to represent a given circuit as a three-dimensional tensor, as illustrated. Crucially, this mapping is invertible: when the DM generates continuous tensors, we can apply the inverse map to convert them back into the circuit form. An overview of these steps is provided in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/circuit_encoding.png\" alt=\"Quantum circuit encoding\" width=\"60%\"/>\n",
    "  <figcaption><b>Quantum circuit encoding</b>. Figure adapted from <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-024-00831-9\">(Fürrutter et al., 2024)</a></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Conditioning:** The user's input (the set of available gates and the unitary to compile) is also transformed into a continuous tensor by two neural networks. For the gate set description, where the input is a text prompt (e.g., \"Compile using ['x', 'h']\"), we utilize a pre-trained language model. For the unitary, we employ a neural network that is training jointly with the diffusion model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Unitary compilation:** The generation procedure follows the typical DM process: the model is given a fully noisy tensor which is iteratively de-noised until reaching a clean sample based on the given conditioning (the desired unitary and gate set). The tensors generated by the DM are then mapped to circuits via the inverse encoding procedure. To learn more about the practical implementation of diffusion models we recommend [this tutorial](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson9.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we will use `CUDA-Q` and `genQC` to perform all these steps and go from a desired unitary matrix, $U$, to a quantum circuit that we can execute using CUDA-Q. "

This is particularly valuable when dealing with hardware constraints, where, for instance, we might want to avoid using certain qubits or specific gates. One practical example is finding the circuit with the fewest Toffoli gates (also known as `ccx`). In our `vocab` definition above, we identified that `ccx` corresponds to the label 5 in our tokenized tensors. Let's use this information to search for the circuit that minimizes the number of `ccx` gates:"
