    "## Noisy Simulation \n",

    "Quantum noise can be characterised into coherent and incoherent sources of errors that arise during a computation. Coherent noise is commonly due to systematic errors originating from device miscalibrations, for example, gates implementing a rotation $\\theta + \\epsilon$ instead of $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incoherent noise has its origins in quantum states being entangled with the environment due to decoherence. This leads to mixed states which are probability distributions over pure states and are described by employing the density matrix formalism. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can model incoherent noise via quantum channels which are linear, completely positive, and trave preserving maps. The mathematical language used is of Kraus operators, $\\{ K_i \\}$, which satisfy the condition $\\sum_{i} K_i^\\dagger K_i = \\mathbb{I}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bit-flip operation flips the qubit with probability $p$ and leaves it unchanged with probability $1-p$. This can be represented by employing Kraus operators: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$K_0 = \\sqrt{1-p} \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "    1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "    0 & 1\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
