        "Histogram-based metrics like Hellinger fidelity break down at scale: with $D = 2^n$ possible bitstrings and a fixed shot budget $N$, most bins are empty once $n > 20$, so bin-by-bin comparisons are dominated by sampling noise. XEB avoids this by scoring each sample against the reference probability for that single outcome, giving an estimator that converges at $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$ regardless of $D$. For a detailed introduction to XEB theory, see [Google's XEB tutorial](https://quantumai.google/cirq/noise/qcvv/xeb_theory).\n",

The resulting metric, $F_{\\text{noisy}}$, directly measures whether PTSBE samples from the same distribution as the DM simulator.\n",

        "*Scalability note.* Computing $p_{\\text{DM}}(x)$ requires the exact diagonal of the $2^n \\times 2^n$ density matrix, which limits this approach to moderate qubit counts. For larger simulations where the full density matrix is infeasible, a sample-only metric like [Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/onurtunali/maximum-mean-discrepancy) could compare the two sampling distributions directly, without access to exact probabilities. MMD measures the distance between two distributions using only samples from each, making it applicable at any scale where both PTSBE and standard trajectory simulation can produce shots."
