        "\n",
        "1. **Density-matrix (DM) reference** (`density-matrix-cpu`): provides exact noisy outcome probabilities $p_{\\text{DM}}(x)$ via the full $2^n \\times 2^n$ density matrix diagonal. Used to compute the $F_{\\text{noisy}}$ metric.\n",
        "2. **Standard noisy sampler** (`nvidia`): performs native per-shot trajectory simulation through `cudaq.sample()` with noise. Scored against the same DM reference as a control.\n",
        "\n",
        "Histogram-based metrics like Hellinger fidelity break down at scale: with $D = 2^n$ possible bitstrings and a fixed shot budget $N$, most bins are empty once $n > 20$, so bin-by-bin comparisons are dominated by sampling noise. XEB avoids this by scoring each sample against the reference probability for that single outcome, giving an estimator that converges at $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$ regardless of $D$. For a detailed introduction to XEB theory, see [Google's XEB tutorial](https://quantumai.google/cirq/noise/qcvv/xeb_theory).\n",

The resulting metric, $F_{\\text{noisy}}$, directly measures whether a sampler draws from the same distribution as the DM reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Scalability note.* Computing $p_{\\text{DM}}(x)$ requires the exact diagonal of the $2^n \\times 2^n$ density matrix, which limits this approach to moderate qubit counts ($n \\le 12$ on CPU). For larger simulations, a sample-only metric like [Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/onurtunali/maximum-mean-discrepancy) can compare the two sampling distributions directly, without access to exact probabilities."
