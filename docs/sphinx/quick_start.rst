**NVIDIA CUDA Quantum**

CUDA Quantum streamlines hybrid application development and promotes productivity and scalability
in quantum algorithm research. It offers a unified programming model designed for a hybrid
setting |---| that is, CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs working together. Further enabling application
acceleration, CUDA Quantum includes language extensions for Python and C++ and a system-level toolchain.

This Quick Start page guides you through getting set up with CUDA Quantum and running your first program.
If you have already installed and configured CUDA Quantum, we encourage you to move directly to our
:ref:`Basics Section <cudaq-basics-landing-page>`.


Python
-------

If you want to develop CUDA Quantum applications using Python, install the
latest stable release of the CUDA Quantum Python API:  

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cuda-quantum

For further information, see the `CUDA Quantum project <https://pypi.org/project/cuda-quantum/>`_ on PyPI.

We also offer a fully featured CUDA Quantum installation, including all C++ and Python tools, via our
`Docker container <https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/cuda-quantum>`_. For further
installation methods and resources, see our :ref:`Installation Guide <install-cuda-quantum>`.

You should now be able to import CUDA Quantum and start building quantum programs in Python!

To test your installation, create a file titled `first_program.py`, containing the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /snippets/python/quick_start.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [Begin Documentation]

You may now execute this file as you do any other Python program. For example, from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 first_program.py

The Hadamard gate places the qubit in a superposition state, giving a roughly 50/50 mixture
of measurments in the `|0>` and `|1>` states.

If you have a local GPU, the following dependencies must be installed before using any GPU accelerated simulation target.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    conda create -y -n cuda-quantum python==3.10 pip
    conda install -y -n cuda-quantum -c "nvidia/label/cuda-11.8.0" cuda
    conda install -y -n cuda-quantum -c conda-forge mpi4py openmpi cxx-compiler cuquantum
    conda env config vars set -n cuda-quantum LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CONDA_PREFIX/envs/cuda-quantum/lib"
    conda env config vars set -n cuda-quantum MPI_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/envs/cuda-quantum
    conda run -n cuda-quantum pip install cuda-quantum
    conda activate cuda-quantum
    source $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.10/site-packages/distributed_interfaces/activate_custom_mpi.sh

When a GPU is detected, the simulation target defaults to `nvidia`. Otherwise, the target will default to the
`qpp-cpu` simulator. To confirm the detection of your GPU, you may once again run the example

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 first_program.py

and confirm that `Simulation Target = nvidia` is printed to the console.

For further information on available targets, see :ref:`Backends <backends-landing-page>`.

Now that you have successfully run your first program, you are ready to move on to our :ref:`Basics Section <cudaq-basics-landing-page>`.


C++
----

To install CUDA Quantum for C++, TODO ...

We also offer a fully featured CUDA Quantum installation, including all C++ and Python tools, via our
`Docker container <https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/cuda-quantum>`_. For further
installation methods and resources, see our :ref:`Installation Guide <install-cuda-quantum>`.

You should now have the CUDA Quantum compiler toolchain available via the command line and are ready to run your first quantum program!

To test your installation, create a file titled `first_program.cpp`, containing the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /snippets/cpp/quick_start.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :start-after: [Begin Documentation]
    :end-before: [End Documentation]

You may now compile and execute this file from the command line using the `nvq++` toolchain:

.. code-block:: bash

    nvq++ first_program.cpp && ./a.out

The Hadamard gate places the qubit in a superposition state, giving a roughly 50/50 mixture
of measurments in the `|0>` and `|1>` states.

Now that you have successfully run your first program, you are ready to move on to our :ref:`Basics Section <cudaq-basics-landing-page>`.
