CUDA-Q Hardware Backends
*********************************

CUDA-Q supports submission to a set of hardware providers. 
To submit to a hardware backend, you need an account with the respective provider.


IonQ
==================================

.. _ionq-backend:

Setting Credentials
`````````````````````````

Programmers of CUDA-Q may access the `IonQ Quantum Cloud
<https://cloud.ionq.com/>`__ from either C++ or Python. Generate
an API key from your `IonQ account <https://cloud.ionq.com/>`__ and export
it as an environment variable:

.. code:: bash

  export IONQ_API_KEY="ionq_generated_api_key"

Submission from C++
`````````````````````````

To target quantum kernel code for execution in the IonQ Cloud,
pass the flag ``--target ionq`` to the ``nvq++`` compiler.

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --target ionq src.cpp

This will take the API key and handle all authentication with, and submission to,
the IonQ QPU(s). By default, quantum kernel code will be submitted to the IonQ
simulator.

.. note:: 

    A "target" in :code:`cudaq` refers to a quantum compute provider, such as :code:`ionq`.
    However, IonQ's documentation uses the term "target" to refer to specific QPU's themselves.

To execute your kernels on a QPU, pass the ``--ionq-machine`` flag to the ``nvq++`` compiler
to specify which machine to submit quantum kernels to:

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --target ionq --ionq-machine qpu.aria-1 src.cpp ...

where ``qpu.aria-1`` is an example of a physical QPU.

A list of available QPUs can be found `in the API documentation
<https://docs.ionq.com/#tag/jobs>`__. To see which backends are available 
with your subscription login to your `IonQ account <https://cloud.ionq.com/jobs>`__.

To emulate the IonQ machine locally, without submitting through the cloud,
you can also pass the ``--emulate`` flag to ``nvq++``. This will emit any target 
specific compiler diagnostics, before running a noise free emulation.

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --emulate --target ionq src.cpp

To see a complete example for using IonQ's backends, take a look at our :doc:`C++ examples <../examples/examples>`.

Submission from Python
`````````````````````````

The target to which quantum kernels are submitted 
can be controlled with the ``cudaq::set_target()`` function.

.. code:: python

    cudaq.set_target('ionq')

By default, quantum kernel code will be submitted to the IonQ
simulator.

.. note:: 

    A "target" in :code:`cudaq` refers to a quantum compute provider, such as :code:`ionq`.
    However, IonQ's documentation uses the term "target" to refer to specific QPU's themselves.

To specify which IonQ QPU to use, set the :code:`qpu` parameter.

.. code:: python

    cudaq.set_target("ionq", qpu="qpu.aria-1")

where ``qpu.aria-1`` is an example of a physical QPU.

A list of available QPUs can be found `in the API documentation
<https://docs.ionq.com/#tag/jobs>`__. To see which backends are available 
with your subscription login to your `IonQ account <https://cloud.ionq.com/jobs>`__.

To emulate the IonQ machine locally, without submitting through the cloud,
you can also set the ``emulate`` flag to ``True``. This will emit any target 
specific compiler diagnostics, before running a noise free emulation.

.. code:: python

    cudaq.set_target('ionq', emulate=True)

The number of shots for a kernel execution can be set through
the ``shots_count`` argument to ``cudaq.sample`` or ``cudaq.observe``. By default,
the ``shots_count`` is set to 1000.

.. code:: python

    cudaq.sample(kernel, shots_count=10000)

To see a complete example for using IonQ's backends, take a look at our :doc:`Python examples <../examples/examples>`.

Anyon Technologies/Anyon Computing
==================================

.. _anyon-backend:

Setting Credentials
```````````````````

Programmers of CUDA-Q may access the Anyon API from either
C++ or Python. Anyon requires a credential configuration file with username and password. 
The configuration file can be generated as follows, replacing
the ``<username>`` and ``<password>`` in the first line with your Anyon Technologies
account details. The credential in the file will be used by CUDA-Q to login to Anyon quantum services 
and will be updated by CUDA-Q with an obtained API token and refresh token. 
Note, the credential line will be deleted in the updated configuration file. 

.. code:: bash
    
    echo 'credentials: {"username":"<username>","password":"<password>"}' > $HOME/.anyon_config

Users can also login and get the keys manually using the following commands:

.. code:: bash

    # You may need to run: `apt-get update && apt-get install curl jq`
    curl -X POST --user "<username>:<password>"  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    https://api.anyon.cloud:5000/login > credentials.json
    id_token=`cat credentials.json | jq -r '."id_token"'`
    refresh_token=`cat credentials.json | jq -r '."refresh_token"'`
    echo "key: $id_token" > ~/.anyon_config
    echo "refresh: $refresh_token" >> ~/.anyon_config

The path to the configuration can be specified as an environment variable:

.. code:: bash

    export CUDAQ_ANYON_CREDENTIALS=$HOME/.anyon_config


Submission from C++
`````````````````````````

To target quantum kernel code for execution in the Anyon Technologies backends,
pass the flag ``--target anyon`` to the ``nvq++`` compiler. CUDA-Q will 
authenticate via the Anyon Technologies REST API using the credential in your configuration file.

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --target anyon --<backend-type> <machine> src.cpp ...

To execute your kernels using Anyon Technologies backends, pass the ``--anyon-machine`` flag to the ``nvq++`` compiler
as the ``--<backend-type>`` to specify which machine to submit quantum kernels to:

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --target anyon --anyon-machine telegraph-8q src.cpp ...

where ``telegraph-8q`` is an example of a physical QPU (Architecture: Telegraph, Qubit Count: 8).

Currently, ``telegraph-8q`` and ``berkeley-25q`` are available for access over CUDA-Q.

To emulate the Anyon Technologies machine locally, without submitting through the cloud,
you can also pass the ``--emulate`` flag as the ``--<backend-type>`` to ``nvq++``. This will emit any target 
specific compiler warnings and diagnostics, before running a noise free emulation.

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --target anyon --emulate src.cpp

To see a complete example for using Anyon's backends, take a look at our :doc:`C++ examples <../examples/examples>`.


Submission from Python
`````````````````````````

The target to which quantum kernels are submitted 
can be controlled with the ``cudaq.set_target()`` function.

To execute your kernels using Anyon Technologies backends, specify which machine to submit quantum kernels to
by setting the :code:`machine` parameter of the target. 
If :code:`machine` is not specified, the default machine will be ``telegraph-8q``.

.. code:: python

    cudaq.set_target('anyon', machine='telegraph-8q')

As shown above, ``telegraph-8q`` is an example of a physical QPU.

To emulate the Anyon Technologies machine locally, without submitting through the cloud,
you can also set the ``emulate`` flag to ``True``. This will emit any target 
specific compiler warnings and diagnostics, before running a noise free emulation.

.. code:: python

    cudaq.set_target('anyon', emulate=True)

The number of shots for a kernel execution can be set through
the ``shots_count`` argument to ``cudaq.sample`` or ``cudaq.observe``. By default,
the ``shots_count`` is set to 1000.

.. code:: python 

    cudaq.sample(kernel, shots_count=10000)

To see a complete example for using Anyon's backends, take a look at our :doc:`Python examples <../examples/examples>`.

IQM
==================================

.. _iqm-backend:

Support for submissions to IQM is currently under development. 
In particular, two-qubit gates can only be performed on adjacent qubits. For more information, we refer to the respective hardware documentation.
Support for automatically injecting the necessary operations during compilation to execute arbitrary multi-qubit gates will be added in future versions.

Setting Credentials
`````````````````````````

Programmers of CUDA-Q may access the IQM Server from either C++ or Python. Following the `quick start guide <https://iqm-finland.github.io/cortex-cli/readme.html#using-cortex-cli>`__, install `iqm-cortex-cli` and login to initialize the tokens file.
The path to the tokens file can either be passed explicitly via an environment variable or it will be loaded automatically if located in
the default location :code:`~/.cache/iqm-cortex-cli/tokens.json`.

.. code:: bash

    export IQM_TOKENS_FILE="path/to/tokens.json"

Submission from C++
`````````````````````````

To target quantum kernel code for execution on an IQM Server,
pass the ``--target iqm`` flag to the ``nvq++`` compiler, along with a specified ``--iqm-machine``.

.. note::
    The ``--iqm-machine`` is  a mandatory argument. This provided architecture must match
    the device architecture that the program has been compiled against. The hardware architecture for a
    specific IQM Server may be checked  via `https://<IQM server>/cocos/quantum-architecture`.

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --target iqm --iqm-machine Adonis src.cpp

Once the binary for a specific IQM QPU architecture is compiled, it can be executed against any IQM Server with the same QPU architecture:

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --target iqm --iqm-machine Adonis src.cpp -o program
    IQM_SERVER_URL="https://demo.qc.iqm.fi/cocos" ./program

    # Executing the same program against an IQM Server with a different underlying QPU
    # architecture will result in an error.
    IQM_SERVER_URL="https://<Apollo IQM Server>/cocos" ./program

To emulate the IQM machine locally, without submitting to the IQM Server,
you can also pass the ``--emulate`` flag to ``nvq++``. This will emit any target
specific compiler diagnostics, before running a noise free emulation.

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --emulate --target iqm --iqm-machine Adonis src.cpp

To see a complete example for using IQM server backends, take a look at our :doc:`C++ examples <../examples/examples>`.

Submission from Python
`````````````````````````

The target to which quantum kernels are submitted
can be controlled with the ``cudaq::set_target()`` function.

.. code:: python

    cudaq.set_target("iqm", url="https://<IQM Server>/cocos", **{"qpu-architecture": "Adonis"})

To emulate the IQM Server locally, without submitting to the IQM Server,
you can also set the ``emulate`` flag to ``True``. This will emit any target
specific compiler diagnostics, before running a noise free emulation.

.. code:: python

    cudaq.set_target('iqm', emulate=True)

The number of shots for a kernel execution can be set through
the ``shots_count`` argument to ``cudaq.sample`` or ``cudaq.observe``. By default,
the ``shots_count`` is set to 1000.

.. code:: python

    cudaq.sample(kernel, shots_count=10000)

To see a complete example for using IQM server backends, take a look at our :doc:`Python examples<../examples/examples>`.

OQC
==================================

.. _oqc-backend:

`Oxford Quantum Circuits <https://oxfordquantumcircuits.com/>`__ (OQC) is currently providing CUDA-Q integration for multiple Quantum Processing Unit types.
The 8 qubit ring topology Lucy device and the 32 qubit Kagome lattice topology Toshiko device are both supported via machine options described below.

Setting Credentials
`````````````````````````

In order to use the OQC devices you will need to register.
Registration is achieved by contacting oqc_qcaas_support@oxfordquantumcircuits.com

Once registered you will be able to authenticate with your ``email`` and ``password``

There are three environment variables that the OQC target will look for during configuration:

1. ``OQC_URL``
2. ``OQC_EMAIL``
3. ``OQC_PASSWORD`` - is mandatory

Submission from C++
`````````````````````````

To target quantum kernel code for execution on the OQC platform, provide the flag ``--target oqc`` to the ``nvq++`` compiler.

Users may provide their :code:`email` and :code:`url` as extra arguments

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --target oqc --oqc-email <email> --oqc-url <url> src.cpp -o executable

Where both environment variables and extra arguments are supplied, precedent is given to the extra arguments.
To run the output, provide the runtime loaded variables and invoke the pre-built executable

.. code:: bash

   OQC_PASSWORD=<password> ./executable

To emulate the OQC device locally, without submitting through the OQC QCaaS services, you can pass the ``--emulate`` flag to ``nvq++``.
This will emit any target specific compiler warnings and diagnostics, before running a noise free emulation.

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --emulate --target oqc src.cpp -o executable


.. note::

    The oqc target supports a ``--oqc-machine`` option.
    The default is the 8 qubit Lucy device.
    You can set this to be either ``toshiko`` or ``lucy`` via this flag.

.. note::

    The OQC quantum assembly toolchain (qat) which is used to compile and execute instructions can be found on github as `oqc-community/qat <https://github.com/oqc-community/qat>`__

Submission from Python
`````````````````````````

To set which OQC URL, set the :code:`url` parameter.
To set which OQC email, set the :code:`email` parameter.
To set which OQC machine, set the :code:`machine` parameter.

.. code:: python

    import os
    import cudaq
    # ...
    os.environ['OQC_PASSWORD'] = password
    cudaq.set_target("oqc", url=url, machine="lucy")

You can then execute a kernel against the platform using the OQC Lucy device

.. code:: python

    kernel = cudaq.make_kernel()
    qvec = kernel.qalloc(2)
    kernel.h(qvec[0])
    kernel.x(qvec[1])
    kernel.cx(qvec[0], qvec[1])
    kernel.mz(qvec)
    str(cudaq.sample(kernel=kernel, shots_count=1000))


ORCA Computing
==================================

.. _orca-backend:

ORCA Computing's PT Series implement the boson sampling model of quantum computation, in which 
multiple single photons are interfered with each other within a network of beam splitters, and 
photon detectors measure where the photons leave this network. This process is implemented within 
a time-bin interferometer (TBI) architecture where photons are created in different time-bins 
and interfered within a network of delay lines. This can be represented by a circuit diagram, 
like the one below, where this illustration example corresponds to 4 photons in 8 modes sent into 
alternating time-bins in a circuit composed of two delay lines in series.

.. image:: ../examples/images/orca_tbi.png
   :width: 400px
   :align: center


Setting Credentials
```````````````````

Programmers of CUDA-Q may access the ORCA API from either C++ or Python. There is an environment 
variable ``ORCA_ACCESS_URL`` that can be set so that the ORCA target can look for it during 
configuration.

.. code:: bash

  export ORCA_ACCESS_URL="https://<ORCA API Server>"


Sometimes the requests to the PT-1 require an authentication token. This token can be set as an
environment variable named ``ORCA_AUTH_TOKEN``. For example, if the token is :code:`AbCdEf123456`,
you can set the environment variable as follows:

.. code:: bash

  export ORCA_AUTH_TOKEN="AbCdEf123456"


Submission from C++
`````````````````````````

To execute a boson sampling experiment on the ORCA platform, provide the flag 
``--target orca`` to the ``nvq++`` compiler. You should then pass the ``--orca-url`` flag set with 
the previously set environment variable ``$ORCA_ACCESS_URL`` or an :code:`url`.

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --target orca --orca-url $ORCA_ACCESS_URL src.cpp -o executable

or

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --target orca --orca-url <url> src.cpp -o executable

To run the output, invoke the executable

.. code:: bash

   ./executable


To see a complete example for using ORCA server backends, take a look at our :doc:`C++ examples <../examples/hardware_providers>`.

Submission from Python
`````````````````````````

To set which ORCA URL to be used, set the :code:`url` parameter.

.. code:: python

    import os
    import cudaq
    # ...
    orca_url = os.getenv("ORCA_ACCESS_URL", "http://localhost/sample")

    cudaq.set_target("orca", url=orca_url)


You can then execute a time-bin boson sampling experiment against the platform using an ORCA device.

.. code:: python

    bs_angles = [np.pi / 3, np.pi / 6]
    input_state = [1, 1, 1]
    loop_lengths = [1]
    counts = cudaq.orca.sample(input_state, loop_lengths, bs_angles)

To see a complete example for using ORCA's backends, take a look at our :doc:`Python examples <../examples/hardware_providers>`.

Quantinuum
==================================

.. _quantinuum-backend:

Setting Credentials
```````````````````

Programmers of CUDA-Q may access the Quantinuum API from either
C++ or Python. Quantinuum requires a credential configuration file. 
The configuration file can be generated as follows, replacing
the ``email`` and ``credentials`` in the first line with your Quantinuum
account details.

.. code:: bash

    # You may need to run: `apt-get update && apt-get install curl jq`
    curl -X POST -H "Content Type: application/json" \
        -d '{ "email":"<your_alias>@email.com","password":"<your_password>" }' \
        https://qapi.quantinuum.com/v1/login > $HOME/credentials.json
    id_token=`cat $HOME/credentials.json | jq -r '."id-token"'`
    refresh_token=`cat $HOME/credentials.json | jq -r '."refresh-token"'`
    echo "key: $id_token" >> $HOME/.quantinuum_config
    echo "refresh: $refresh_token" >> $HOME/.quantinuum_config

The path to the configuration can be specified as an environment variable:

.. code:: bash

    export CUDAQ_QUANTINUUM_CREDENTIALS=$HOME/.quantinuum_config


Submission from C++
`````````````````````````

To target quantum kernel code for execution in the Quantinuum backends,
pass the flag ``--target quantinuum`` to the ``nvq++`` compiler. CUDA-Q will 
authenticate via the Quantinuum REST API using the credential in your configuration file.
By default, quantum kernel code will be submitted to the Quantinuum syntax checker.
Submission to the syntax checker merely validates the program; the kernels are not executed.

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --target quantinuum src.cpp ...

To execute your kernels, pass the ``--quantinuum-machine`` flag to the ``nvq++`` compiler
to specify which machine to submit quantum kernels to:

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --target quantinuum --quantinuum-machine H1-2 src.cpp ...

where ``H1-2`` is an example of a physical QPU. Hardware specific
emulators may be accessed by appending an ``E`` to the end (e.g, ``H1-2E``). For 
access to the syntax checker for the provided machine, you may append an ``SC`` 
to the end (e.g, ``H1-1SC``).

For a comprehensive list of available machines, login to your `Quantinuum user account <https://um.qapi.quantinuum.com/user>`__ 
and navigate to the "Account" tab, where you should find a table titled "Machines".

To emulate the Quantinuum machine locally, without submitting through the cloud,
you can also pass the ``--emulate`` flag to ``nvq++``. This will emit any target 
specific compiler warnings and diagnostics, before running a noise free emulation.

.. code:: bash

    nvq++ --emulate --target quantinuum src.cpp

To see a complete example for using Quantinuum's backends, take a look at our :doc:`C++ examples <../examples/examples>`.


Submission from Python
`````````````````````````

The target to which quantum kernels are submitted 
can be controlled with the ``cudaq::set_target()`` function.

.. code:: python

    cudaq.set_target('quantinuum')

By default, quantum kernel code will be submitted to the Quantinuum syntax checker.
Submission to the syntax checker merely validates the program; the kernels are not executed.

To execute your kernels, specify which machine to submit quantum kernels to
by setting the :code:`machine` parameter of the target.

.. code:: python

    cudaq.set_target('quantinuum', machine='H1-2')

where ``H1-2`` is an example of a physical QPU. Hardware specific
emulators may be accessed by appending an ``E`` to the end (e.g, ``H1-2E``). For 
access to the syntax checker for the provided machine, you may append an ``SC`` 
to the end (e.g, ``H1-1SC``).

For a comprehensive list of available machines, login to your `Quantinuum user account <https://um.qapi.quantinuum.com/user>`__ 
and navigate to the "Account" tab, where you should find a table titled "Machines".

To emulate the Quantinuum machine locally, without submitting through the cloud,
you can also set the ``emulate`` flag to ``True``. This will emit any target 
specific compiler warnings and diagnostics, before running a noise free emulation.

.. code:: python

    cudaq.set_target('quantinuum', emulate=True)

The number of shots for a kernel execution can be set through
the ``shots_count`` argument to ``cudaq.sample`` or ``cudaq.observe``. By default,
the ``shots_count`` is set to 1000.

.. code:: python 

    cudaq.sample(kernel, shots_count=10000)
